This is an app for creating a repl in node or browser that runs custom cli-style commands.

Build with `yarn build`.
Run an example with 
- `yarn http-serve`
- open the browser to localhost:8080
- in the text area, enter e.g. `match scalar -l 100 -r 101`, a test command
- this should print output, the command's result
